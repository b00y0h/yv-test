<p>Sharks are dominant. They’re strong, fast and adaptable. Sharks always prevail. At Nova Southeastern University, we create sharks. We give students the competitive advantage they need to become confident, capable, yet caring professionals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IEEmqDiGFA" title="Get the NSU Edge"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/6IEEmqDiGFA/0.jpg" alt="The NSU Edge is about real-world learning that goes beyond the classroom. Nova Southeastern University students learn more through personal attention, more hands-on experiences and unique career development opportunities that set them up for success." /></a></p>

<p>Preparing to dominate is not about winning or losing. It’s about harnessing the best within yourself—and using that to inspire others—on the job, in your community, in the relationships you build. It’s about driving forward and becoming an unstoppable force of nature.</p>

<p>With a fast track to graduation, personal career coaches, access to our vast network of industry partners and a chance to explore your personal passions, you will always have an edge.</p>
